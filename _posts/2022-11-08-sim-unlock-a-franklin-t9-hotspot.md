In the PhilTel demo rig, we make use of an older Franklin T9 LTE hotspot for Internet access. These hotspots are widely available as they were given out for free by T-Mobile and are able to be unlocked and hacked to support multiple carriers provided they are operating in GSM bands.

## Perform the SIM Unlock

To perform this unlock you will need a Linux/Mac machine and the IMEI of your hotspot. The IMEI is usually on a sticker inside the battery department, but it may also be on the web interface somewhere (I think the *About* page).

In a terminal on your computer, run the following commands, replacing `YOURIMEIGOESHERE` with the IMEI of your device:

```
export IMEI=YOURIMEIGOESHERE
echo -n "${IMEI}simlock" | sha1sum | cut -c1-8
```

After performing the above, a code should be output in the terminal.

Log in to your Franklin device (the web interface is usually at `192.168.0.1` and the password is usually either `admin` or `password`) and click on the *Settings* icon from the top navigation. Now from the left navigation, go to *Mobile Network* --> *SIM* and scroll down the the *Carrier Unlock* section. Under *Desired Action* select *Carrier Unlock* from the dropdown and under *Enter Unlock Code* enter the code you generated in the terminal earlier. Finally, press the button for *Unlock* to unlock your device.

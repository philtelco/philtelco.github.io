We're happy to announce a new ROM swapping service for Nortel Millennium phones in conjunction with [RandTel](https://randtel.co/eeprom.html) and others in the community!  

Do you own a Nortel Millennium payphone and want your phone to work like a normal landline phone that can take/make calls with no coins and no other special equipment running? Did you know that the software currently in your phone may not be recovered/known yet and be important to tinkerers and preservationists?  

We have several volunteers ready to receive your old ROM chip from your phone and send you a chip programmed to allow the phone to act like a traditional landline phone! Further, they will backup the current software on your old ROM chip to archive and make available to the community.  

To participate in the swap, you can do the following:
1. Join [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/SajjE7Bq9F) (it's fast and free) and make a message in the `#nortel-millennium` chat channel stating you want to participate in a ROM swap, as well as your general location (city, state/country)
2. A volunteer will walk you through the process of removing the old EEPROM chip from your phone and privately share an address for you to send your chip.
3. Upon receiving the chip, the volunteer will program you a fresh chip and mail it back to you.
4. When your new chip arrives, simply slot it in to your phone and run a short setup process.

That's all it takes! We hope that this process will help Millennium owners easily be able to get their phones working while also preserving software that would otherwise be lost.

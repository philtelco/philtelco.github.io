We're building an amateur phone collective in Philadelphia! Are you a hacker, artist, or engineer? We need your help!

Philtel is looking to install new (to us) payphones within the city of Philadelphia. Any payphone installed will be completely free-to-use, allowing the user to place calls within North America. Additionally, we would like to provide various experiences and services through the phones; these could be as simple as voicemail, fun as a phone number that randomly calls other payphones, or as complex as an integration with phone collectors' networks to allow [phone-phreaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phreaking){:target="_blank"} and exploration!

Want to know how we are building the network? Check out the [about](../about) page!

Philtel was founded in June 2022 and was inspired by [Futel](http://futel.net/).

We hope to have our first payphone installed in the coming months!

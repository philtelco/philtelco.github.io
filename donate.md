## Donations

Monetary donations can be made via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/philtel){:target="_blank"}, [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/philtel){:target="_blank"}, and/or [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/philtelco){:target="_blank"}.

We also have print-on-demand clothing for sale [here](https://philtel.myspreadshop.com/all){:target="_blank"}, with ~$4 of each purchase going to support PhilTel!

Alternatively, coins can be donated by dropping them directly into the coin slot on a PhilTel phone (no change given).

## Sponsors

To grow our footprint within the city, we will need locations to install payphones. Do you or someone you know have ownership of a location where a payphone can be installed? [Let us know](../contact)!

## Donations

Monetary donations can be made via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/philtel){:target="_blank"} and/or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/philtel){:target="_blank"}. 

We also have print-on-demand clothing for sale [here](https://philtel.myspreadshop.com/all){:target="_blank"}, with ~$4.50 of each purchase going to support PhilTel!

Alternatively, coins can be donated by dropping them directly into the coin slot on a PhilTel phone (no change given).

## Sponsors

To grow our footprint within the city, we will need locations to install payphones. Do you or someone you know have ownership of a location where a payphone can be installed? [Let us know](../contact)!

## Wishlist

PhilTel is always in search of hardware to support our infrastructure and installations. If you have any of the following items that you would like to part with, please [contact us](../contact)!

* Payphones and payphone parts (including handsets, keys, vault doors, keypads, etc.)
* Payphone enclosures (boothetes, pedestals, backplates, etc.)
